                        <br>
                      <p>It is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that aims to identify important needs in vulnerable communities in Haiti, Mexico and other countries in the region.
                            Working through our three pillars, State of Law-Human Rights, Durable Development, and Gender Equity, Eccopoli funds projects to improve communities in these three areas.
                             </p>
                             <br>
                             <button id="vermas" onclick=vermas()>Ver más</button>
                        </div>
                             <div id="mlargo" style="display: none;">
                             <br>
                             <p>
                                    Eccopoli works as follows: First, issues of importance are defined with the help of communities, and once the issues that require intervention are identified, Eccopoli, through the allocation and distribution of different sources of financing, intervenes and develops projects to help the community in question solve their problem. Examples of this are: Haitian communities struggling with insufficient funds for the rule of law to be effective, for example the lack of police stations; lack of gender equity in different sectors, and lack of drinking water and electricity.
                                </p>
                             <br>
                             <p>
                                    Eccopoli also takes as a framework for action the new Sustainable Development Goals (MDS) of the United Nations by 2030. The objective of the NGO is to implement a project within the seventeen (17) MDS each year until 2030. Eccopoli is struggling to be an important actor and to act as a catalyst for change by prioritizing MDS, taking the framework they propose in its structure.
